This code simulates the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol. 
It prepares quantum states for Alice, randomly selects measurement bases for Bob, measures the states accordingly, and extracts sifted keys by comparing bases. 
It calculates the error rate as the ratio of the number of differing bits to the total number of bits.
A hash function for the privacy amplification section is NOT demonstrated here.
